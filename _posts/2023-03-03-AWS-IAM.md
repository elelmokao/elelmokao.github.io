## Overview of AWS IAM

## IAM Components
* **Users** - Gain permissions applied to the group through policy.
    * Account root user - with full permissions
    * Users - up to 5000 users. 
    * Can be authenticated via username/password for console or access keys for API/CLI.
* **Group** - Way to categorize and organized users.
    * Up to 10 groups per IAM.
    * Manage users well through group.
* **Roles** - Used for delegation and are assumed. 
    * An IAM identity having specific permissions
    * The role can be "assumed" to the users, applications, or services.
* **Policies** - Define the permissions for identities or resources they are associated with.
    * Documents defining permissions and written in JSON.
    * By default, all permissions are **denied**.
    * Types:
        * **Identity-based policies**: assumed and managing identities (user, group, role)
        * **Resource-based policies**: assumed and managed services (EC2, S3)
